Peak finder ==>
sorting and tree ==> bunch of number, trillion Event Simulation
Hashing==> Genome Comparison
Numerics=> RSA Encryption (32 bit 64bits ==> https==> SSL ==> use RSA used )
Graphs ==> Rubik Cube 
Shorter path ==> Caltech-> MIT
Dynamic Programming => Image compression (no. of pixes reduce)

Greedy Accent Algorithm
pick a direction
non-trivial question

you are being very paranoid


O(1) ==> constant time ==> delta

L.append(x) ==> linear time == allocating new and then copy of it==> doesn't do that
it does table doubling(L9)

L = L1 + L2 ==> == take cost
L=[]
fox x in L1
L.append(x)
for x in L2
L.append(x)
X in L ==> take linear time 

Len(L) ==> it alwasy store the length at beginning
L.sort() ==> O(L Log L) ==> time to compare
dict :  hashing
D[key]= val ==> O(1)
lg ==> log base 2

Long
x+y ==> O(x+y)
x*y ==> O(x+y) exponent lg 3 ==> log base 2 of 3

heapq ==> python standard library

d' ==> d prime
how to measure two vector are
product

summer of word D1[W] ==> D1 w times
Divide by length in vector
Angle between two vectors

Algorithm
1=> split document to words
2=> compute word frequency
3=> dot product

re take explanatory time (linear time)
1=> re.findall(r'\w+',doc) // don't use it careful if you use it


sorting was used in Data compression
Computer graphics when redener.


Insertion Sort =>
pairwise swap down to the correct position
0(n2) Comparison Cost


Do a binary search on A[0:i-1] already sorted
in 0(lg i) time 0(n lg n) compares

Merge Sort
Divide & Conquer

Two sorted arrays as input and combine it into sorted array
0(n) complexity
T(n) = C1 (divide) + 2T(n/2)  [recursion]+ C.n (merge)

1+lg n ==> no. of Level
n Leaves ==> no. leaves

Heaps and Heap Sort
Heap is implementation of priority queue
Complexity O(lgn)

Max Heap
seapare into binary tree
and root note must be greater than sub note

Max Heapify
complexity ==> O(nlgn) simple analysis
Priority Queue

Bounded by constant

Mathematics Lecture 1
Mathematical proof is verification of a proposition
by achain of logical deductions from a set of Axioms.

A Propostion is a statement that is either true or false.
Example => 2+3 = 5;
Predicate is a proposition whose truth depend on value of variable.


a expoent 4 ==> a to the 4

E ေျပာင္းျပန္ there exist
N=> P

n+ positive natural number
the region any math can be colored in 4 colors so that adjacent region have different colors 

Every even integer  but z is sum of two primes (GO Back conjuction)
for examp>24 = 11+13

Implication p=>q is true if p is False or q is True
False Implies anything is true

<=> if and only if
have impllication both waty <= and =>

propostion => hello, question , Neither True of False

Axiom 
is a proposition that is "assumed" to be true

Axiom should be 
1. Consistent
2. Complete

A set of Axiom is cosistent if no proposition can be prove True and false. 
A set of Axiom is complete if it can be used to prove every prpopostion is True or False.

Lecture 2
7P not P
Proof by Contradiction
To prove P is true, we will assume P is false(7P is true)and then use that hypothesis to derive
a false hood of contradiction.
7P => False is True
